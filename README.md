# Programming Site
For the Programming (Black) project.  
Describes some of the important work that computer science is doing.  
Accessible from [here](https://jshepherd01.github.io/)  

## To make changes:
Since you've been added as colaborators, you *should* be able to push changes whenever you want. If that's not working, you'll need to do it the "correct" way, following the instructions [here](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/fork.html).  

## If you need someone else to make a change:
Click on the ```Issues``` button along the top bar, and create a new issue with the change you want made. I'll see the issue and do it when I get time. If there are other issues there that you can handle, feel free to work on them yourselves.  

## If you need to talk to me for whatever reason:
You could open an ```Issue``` from the bar at the top, or message me on Discord at j_shepherd01#3487.
